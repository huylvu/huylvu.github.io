                                <p>This research examines the impact of industrial agglomeration on the productivity of SMEs in Vietnam, using FE regression for panel data and the PSM method. The study utilizes data from the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (2016–2020) and the OECD's TiVA database. The findings highlight the positive effects of industrial parks on firm performance, particularly for medium-sized enterprises, export-oriented firms, and those integrated into global value chains. SMEs with strong international linkages benefit from improved access to modern production technologies, with FDI capital firms exhibiting the highest productivity gains. Furthermore, the performance of industrial parks exhibits significant geographical variation, with the Southern region demonstrating superior efficiency due to the concentration of large industrial clusters and advanced facilities. High-tech zones have emerged as key drivers of regional productivity, fostering industrialization and technological innovation. Policymakers should prioritize the expansion and modernization of industrial zones, promote trade liberalization, and support SMEs through targeted incentives while strengthening FDI linkages to drive sustainable industrial development.</p>

                                <p>Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria have increasingly become central to the strategic development of enterprises. However, the necessity and tangible impacts of ESG adoption within firms remain underexplored. This study addresses these gaps by investigating the causal effects of ESG implementation among the top 20 ESG-leading firms in Vietnam between 2017 and 2022 on corporate performance. We further analyze the spillover effects of these “Superstar” firms on other businesses within the same geographical regions, regardless of industry. Using data from the Vietnam Enterprise Survey and applying Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and Difference-in-Differences (DiD) methodologies, our findings reveal that adoption of ESG significantly enhances productivity for leading firms. In addition, spillover effects are observed in geographically proximate firms, even those outside the same sectors. Finally, we assess the broader impact of these spillover effects on pollution levels, greenhouse gas emissions, and household health. The results indicate positive environmental and social outcomes, underscoring the need for broader adoption of ESG across sectors.</p>

                                <p>This study examines the impact of climate change on human health in Vietnam, focusing on healthcare and agricultural expenditures. Employing a natural regression discontinuity design (RDD) with a non-parametric approach, the research identifies the causal effects of rising temperatures on health-related costs. To ensure robustness, the analysis is further supported by the use of instrumental variable (IV) and Fuzzy RD designs. The findings reveal that a 1-degree Celsius increase in average temperature leads to an 80\% rise in healthcare expenditure, an 84\% increase in agricultural expenditure, and an 11\% rise in medical treatment costs. These results highlight the substantial economic burden posed by climate change, particularly on public health systems and agriculture. By establishing a clear causal link between climate change and healthcare expenditures, this research provides valuable insights for policymakers and public health officials. The findings can inform the development of effective adaptation strategies, heatwave management plans, and public interventions to mitigate the health impacts of climate change in Vietnam.</p>

                                <p>This paper aims to examine the trend in the affordability of tobacco products in Viet Nam from 2018 to 2020, during which the government implemented an increase of five percentage points in the tobacco tax across all tobacco products. Analyzing three waves of data from the International Tobacco Control Survey in Viet Nam, we measure the affordability of tobacco products at the individual level using two different methods: the ratio of the self-reported price or retailer-reported price of tobacco to self-reported income or expenditure. A robustness check with instrumental variables is also conducted using data from the Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey to validate average income and expenditure levels. The findings show that, in 2019, individual incomes grew substantially faster than tobacco prices following the tax increase, indicating that tobacco products remained relatively affordable. Our research outcomes highlight an urgent need for tax policies to align with income growth in order to effectively reduce tobacco consumption in Viet Nam.</p>
